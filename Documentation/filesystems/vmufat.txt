VMUFAT FILESYSTEM

VMUFAT is the simple file allocation table (FAT) based filesystem used in Sega
Dreamcast Visual Memory Units (VMUs) and various Dreamcast emulators and
Android apps etc.

It is not recommended for general use, but does not require a Dreamcast.

All the physical VMU devices that were made were of the same size 256 blocks
of 512 octets - 128KB in total. But the specification supports a wider range
of sizes and the filesystem in the Linux kernel is capable of handling volumes
of a size between 128 blocks and 4096 blocks.

The standard 256 block VMU is described below

BLOCK NO	Content
0		Space used by Dreamcast
		to save files
199
200		Space which can be used but
		which the Dreamcast ignores
240
241		Directory (can hold 208
		file records)
253
254		File Allocation Table (FAT)
255		Root Block

The standard VMU filesystem has 241 blocks which can be used for file storage
but a Dreamcast will only use 200 of these. The Linux kernel driver prefers to
use blocks 0 - 199 when allocating blocks to files, but will use blocks 200 -
240 if lower numbered blocks are not available.

Executible file must begin at block 0 and be stored linearly in the volume.

DIRECTORY
The directory contains records 32 octets long (format detail below from Marcus
Comstedt's website - http://mc.pp.se/dc/vms/flashmem.html)
0x00      : file type (0x00 = no file, 0x33 = data, 0xcc = game)
0x01      : copy protect (0x00 = copy ok, 0xff = copy protected)
0x02-0x03 : 16 bits (little endian) : location of first block
0x04-0x0f : ASCII string : filename (12 characters)
0x10-0x17 : Binary Coded Decimal timestamp: file creation time
0x18-0x19 : 16 bits (little endian) : file size (in blocks)
0x1a-0x1b : 16 bits (little endian) : offset of header (in blocks)
	    from file start

Header positioning is a matter for executible files written in native
code for a physical VMU (an 8 bit Sanyo microcontroller).

BCD dates are encoded as follows:
Century prefix (eg., 20)
Year (eg., 12)
Month (eg., 02)
Day in month (eg., 29)
Hour (eg., 20)
Minute (eg., 49)
Second (eg., 22)
Day of week (Monday is 00, Sunday is 06)


FILE ALLOCATION TABLE
Every block in the volume is mapped to the FAT eg., block 0 of the VMU maps to
the first 16 bits of the FAT and so on. Blocks marked 0xFFFC are empty, blocks
allocated to a file are either numbered with with next block or, if the final
block are marked 0xFFFA.

ROOT BLOCK
The first 16 octets are marked as 0x55 - we use this to provide the "magic
number" for this filesystem. The octets at 0x10 - 0x14 are used to determine
the colour the representation of VMU is displayed in by a Dreamcast and our
filesystem does not touch these.
Octets 0x30 - 0x37 contain the BCD timestamp of the VMU.
Octets 0x46 - 0x47 contain the location (little endian format) of the FAT
Octets 0x48 - 0x49 contain the size (little endian) of the FAT
Octets 0x4A - 0x4B contain the location (little endian) of the Directory
Octets 0x4C - 0x4D contain the size (little endian) of the Directory
Octets 0x4E - 0x4F is Dreamcast specific (icon shape)
Octets 0x50 - 0x51 contain the number (little endian) of user blocks - NB this
is marked as 200 in a physical VMU although there are in fact 241 usable
blocks - the reason appears to be that the Directory is not big enough to
support 1 block files in all user blocks.
